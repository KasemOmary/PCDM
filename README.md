# PCDM - RDBMS - MySQL Modification
~~[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pcdm.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pcdm)~~

### This version is NOT released on PyPI 

This version has been updated for an ENV driven build thru the deploy_sql.py file. The SQLAlchemy build has also been modified to work with MySQL/MariaDB. Nothing major has been changed besides that. 

You probably know what you're doing if you're messing with this, so hopefully you don't need support. ðŸ™‚

### Known Issues

1. **Failed foreign key constraint**
[party.py#L844](https://github.com/KasemOmary/PCDM/blob/269f5bed2e216cf79ffa5c12008527852c5c49e5/pcdm/party.py#L844)
[party.py#L871](https://github.com/KasemOmary/PCDM/blob/269f5bed2e216cf79ffa5c12008527852c5c49e5/pcdm/party.py#L871)

Due to some odd issue with `relationship_type_code` & `relationship_begin_date` - an error is popping up on build.

This is a DB error and not an error with SQLAlchemy. Following is the error message:

```sh
sqlalchemy.exc.DatabaseError: (mysql.connector.errors.DatabaseError) 1822 (HY000): Failed to add the foreign key constraint. Missing index for constraint 'party_relationship_role_ibfk_3' in the referenced table 'party_relationship'
[SQL:

        party_relationship_role_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        party_id INTEGER,
        related_party_id INTEGER,
        relationship_type_code VARCHAR(10),
        relationship_begin_date DATE,
        party_role_code VARCHAR(10),
        role_begin_date DATE,
        PRIMARY KEY (party_relationship_role_id),
        FOREIGN KEY(party_id) REFERENCES party_relationship (party_id),
        FOREIGN KEY(related_party_id) REFERENCES party_relationship (related_party_id),
        FOREIGN KEY(relationship_begin_date) REFERENCES party_relationship (begin_date),
        FOREIGN KEY(party_role_code) REFERENCES party_role (party_role_code)
)
```

### Property Casualty Data Model

PCDM is a [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) implementation of [Object Management Group's Property Casualty Data Model](https://www.omg.org/spec/PC/About-PC/). The Property Casualty Data Model is a relational database schema that closely resembles the backend of an insurance company. This package allows you to deploy a SQLite database within seconds for testing, and can be tweaked to support Postgres and other relational database systems.

PCDM contains 256 tables from 13 subject area models (SAMs):

1. Party - all persons, organizations, and groups involved in the insurance agreement
2. Account and Agreement - customer, insurer, and vendor agreements
3. Policy - policy information
4. Claim - claim information
5. Assessment - information pertaining to assesment (credit scoring, appraisals)
6. Agreement Role - roles involved in agreements (providers, producers, suppliers)
7. Claim Role - roles involved in claims (claimaints, adjusters)
8. Staffing Role - roles involved in staffing (employees and contractors)
9. Party Subtype - groupings and subgroupings of parties
10. Insurable Object - things that can be insured (vehicles, structures)
11. Money - transaction information
12. Event - event information
13. Product - product information (line of business, limits, coverage)
